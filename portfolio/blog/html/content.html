        My brother went to Poland last weekend and left me one of his guitar amps. <br>
        I plugged in the electric guitar I had kicking around (AKA "the fury"), and I can't stop, I'm totally hooked.<br>
        I'm having the most fun playing music I have had in years.<br><br>
        I think my poor piano is getting jealous though.<br>
