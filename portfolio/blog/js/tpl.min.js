You must maintain good health and vitality in every part of your body.<br><br>\n        <b>2)</b> Develop a strong spirit. Your skill and spirit must be in perfect harmony. This will enable you to adapt and to cope\n        with even the harshest of environments.<br><br>\n        <b>3)</b> Training is critical. Your mind, spirit, hands and feet are to combine to work as one. Practice diligently to attain this.<br><br>\n        <b>4)</b> Experiment and use your mind. Doing this will bring you closer to enlightenment as well as improve your skill and\n        techniques.</br><br>\n        <b>5)</b> Fundamental Training. Practicing basic techniques must be done properly. Posture, stance, grip, line of sight, footwork,\n        attacking are critical.

The path of Kendo is to train\n        seriously in order to build character.<br><br>\n        <b>10)</b> Live the way you train. Do not separate what you learned in Kendo from your everyday life.

I\'ve always felt as though the \n        attitude that beginners are a waste of time is a burden on one\'s kendo development. It demonstrates\n        a lack of patience and a lack of compassion, and is often accompanied by a lack of adequate respect \n        for Kendo basics. <br>\n        A few months back I happened upon a little article on the subject written by Kim Taylor Sensei. Though\n        I believe this is originally written about Iaido, it all holds true for Kendo as well. <br><br>\n\n        "While beginners may seem a pain in the touchus, slowing down the class and making you repeat the same\n        old thing, they really are quite useful. For one thing having a beginner in class lets the previous\n        group of beginners know just how much they know. It\'s amazing how fast the previous beginners let go of\n        their worries that they aren\'t learning anything when they realize just how much they understand in \n        comparison to the new guy.<br>\n        Beginners slow the class down, that\'s true, but this isn\'t a bad thing. Going fast during class can \n        often mean going into automatic pilot, just repeating the kata without thinking about what you\'re doing\n        with them. You\'re supposed to break this stuff down and try to understand the lessons behind and beneath \n        the kata but you can\'t really do that if you simply repeat them endlessly at speed. Beginners ask\n        questions, they trigger thoughts of why this movement instead of that one. <br>\n        As for repeating the same old thing, what makes us think we\'ve repeated whatever we need to repeat to\n        the last bunch of beginners? I realized a few weeks ago that I hadn\'t told any of my students a quite\n        fundamental thing in several years. This happened when a beginner asked a question and I answered \n        causing the rest of the class to give me the aha look. That\'s when I realized I had forgotten something\n        yet again.<br>\n        So celebrate the beginners, those few brave souls who wander into a class full of flying lumber and\n        put their faith into the kindness of the group. They in turn will be welcoming beginners in the way \n        they were welcomed in years to come. <br><br>\n        Treat them well, you need them.<br><br>\n        Kim Taylor <br><br>\n        Sept 21, 2015"\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div class="post" ng-show="!code">\n    <div class="title orange">\n        Web Fonts\n        <div class="date">\n            Nov 24th 2015 | Code \n        </div>\n        <div class="icon">\n            <i class="fa fa-code"></i>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class="content">\n       Looking around for a nice font for this site, and I stumbled across this helpful article: </br><br>\n       <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/typography/free-web-fonts-1131610?page=1">The 35 Greatest Free Web Fonts</a>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div class="post" ng-show="!music">\n    <div class="title red">\n        Hooked on the electric guitar\n        <div class="date">\n            Nov 23rd 2015 | Music\n        </div>\n        <div class="icon">\n            <i class="fa fa-music"></i>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class="content">\n        My brother went to Poland last weekend and left me one of his guitar amps. <br>\n        I plugged in the electric guitar I had kicking around (AKA "the fury"), and I can\'t stop, I\'m totally hooked.<br>\n        I\'m having the most fun playing music I have had in years.<br><br>\n        I think my poor piano is getting jealous though.<br>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div class="post" ng-show="!life">\n    <div class="title purple">\n        I finally did it! \n        <div class="date">\n            Nov 23rd 2015 | Life\n        </div>\n        <div class="icon">\n            <i class="fa fa-home"></i>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class="content">\n        I finally built that blog I\'ve been talking about forever.
