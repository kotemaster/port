<h1>Form test example</h1>
<h3>Main task:</h3>
The idea is to play around with standard form input fields inside a form element:
<ul>
    <li>text</li>
    <li>textarea</li>
    <li>select</li>
    <li>radio buttons</li>
    <li>checkboxes</li>
    <li>buttons</li>
</ul>

<h3>Subtask: reading input values from form fields</h3>
This is more advanced introduction to dynamic pages.  The main purpose is for you to see what can be done with form data once the user enters it in the form.
I will do the javascript/jQuery part and you will do CSS.  This is a typical work breakdown in a development environment: one guy does backend another javascript and another css.
Once you get a decent command of css you will start moving in the direction of javascript, but that's later.

<h4>jQuery</h4>
I am adding jQuery library so that we can test if the forms save data correctly.

<h4>&lt;link&gt; and &ltscript&gt; tags pointing to various directories</h4>
