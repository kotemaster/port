"No Martial Art symbolizes the spirit of the warrior more than the art of kendo ("The way of the Sword"). 
Although the metal swords have been replaced by bamboo and wood, all other aspects of the Samurai Spirit live on in the practice of Kendo. 
<br /> <br />
Hollywood movies such as “The Last Samurai” exposed the art of Kendo to a huge audience, many of whom are unaware that over 40 countries participate in a world Championship, 
and 10 million practice worldwide.
<br /> <br />
Kendo requires a strong spirit, physical strength and mental attitude to avoid defeat;
Each attack is undertaken as it would have been from the Samurai, where death is the only outcome. 
<br /> <br />
Strike a killing blow requires good technique, but victory requires a single mindedness to defeat the opponent. 
In Kendo such courageous attacks develop the spirit which is necessary for victory." <br />

"To mold the mind and body; to cultivate a vigorous spirit; and through correct and rigid training; 
to strive for improvement in the arts of Kendo and Iaido; to hold in esteem human courtesy and honor; 
to associate with others with sincerity; and to forever pursue the cultivation of one's self"
