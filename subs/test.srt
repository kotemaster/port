HELP, HELP, HELP, ...


27
00:03:38,296 --> 00:03:40,190
STAND DOWN !!!

28
00:03:42,296 --> 00:03:43,890
Leave him alone, what's going on

29
00:03:44,696 --> 00:03:45,890
Little misunderstanding

30
00:03:46,296 --> 00:03:47,890
Little or big?

31
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:50,890
medium

32
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,490
Disperse, right now!

33
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,890
One against three

34
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,290
How unfortunate

35
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,890
Damn

36
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,390
Did you see that girl?

37
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,590
Which girl?

37
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,390
The one with the braid, stood here, dissappeared

38
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:48,190
I don't know anything, sir, 
girls don't concern me

39
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,590
Oh, tobacco, not bad, aromatic

40
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,590
Would you know if there are 
any forests in the area?

41
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,590
No I don't, I am not from around here

41
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,590
Your train took off

42
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,590
Do you now when the next one will come?

43
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,590
Maybe in an hour, or three days,
are you in a hurry?

44
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,890
No, I am not

45
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,890
Do you have any work around here?

46
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,990
Come with us, we could use a <i>cowboy</i> like you

47
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,290
... and pants

47
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,200
what?

47
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,390
pants, will you give me a pair

48
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,290
well, not right away

49
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,890
I need them

00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,290
new pants

50
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,790
Besides, I am looking for something ... more quiet

51
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,890
Go and see the supervisor

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,890
over there, in the castle behind the river

52
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,590
Good Day

53
00:06:41,700--> 00:06:42,890
Good Day

54
00:06:42,900--> 00:06:44,290
Do you know this building?

56
00:06:44,700--> 00:06:45,290
a bit

57
00:06:46,000--> 00:06:48,290
I am looking for the supervisor

58
00:06:48,500--> 00:06:49,290
what for?

59
00:06:50,500--> 00:06:52,290
professional secret

60
00:06:53,400--> 00:06:54,800
professional secret?

00:06:55,100--> 00:06:57,000
Well, let's go 

61
00:07:15,000--> 00:07:16,000
Please ...

62
00:07:19,700--> 00:07:20,400
It is you

63
00:07:22,600--> 00:07:24,800
What is this professional secret?

64
00:07:25,800--> 00:07:26,800
regarding work

65
00:07:27,200--> 00:07:31,000
Aha, your profession?

66
00:07:31,300--> 00:07:34,100
I studied Education.

67
00:07:35,000--> 00:07:38,500
Write down your last name, ... first

68
00:07:44,000--> 00:07:45,000
from <i>the camp</i>?

69
00:07:48,300--> 00:07:50,200
can't hide it

69
00:07:51,300--> 00:07:53,900
You are the first teacher

70
00:07:54,800--> 00:07:59,000
You realize that we need to 
start organizing everything from the start 

71
00:07:59,010--> 00:08:00,000
I don't want to teach

72
00:08:01,000--> 00:08:02,000
Why not?

73
00:08:02,800--> 00:08:05,800
I can't, I am not fit for it.

74
00:08:06,700--> 00:08:07,800
So, what do you want to do?

75
00:08:12,000--> 00:08:13,800
I want to be a forest ranger

76
00:08:15,800--> 00:08:17,800
A forest ranger

00:08:20,300--> 00:08:23,800
Come back in a week

77
00:08:26,000--> 00:08:28,100
In a week I will be somewhere else

78
00:08:28,400--> 00:08:30,300
Could you ration me a pair of pants?

79
00:08:31,000--> 00:08:33,800
Will you help us organize our Education?

80
00:08:34,000--> 00:08:35,800
no

81
00:08:36,700--> 00:08:38,700
And a sense of duty, things like that, nothing?

82
00:08:39,100--> 00:08:40,000
Good Bye

83
00:08:57,800--> 00:09:00,000
hey, hallo

84
00:09:03,500--> 00:09:05,000
Which camp were you in?

85
00:09:06,800--> 00:09:10,300
in Auschwitz, ... and later in Dachau

86
00:09:10,900--> 00:09:16,000
I was in Pawiak, Majdanek, Buchenwald, Mauthausen, Oranienburg

87
00:09:19,300--> 00:09:22,000
You were in Mauthausen also

88
00:09:22,300--> 00:09:24,000
that's right, that's right

89
00:09:28,300--> 00:09:29,300
Czesiek

90
00:09:29,800--> 00:09:30,900
Andrzej

91
00:09:32,800--> 00:09:35,000
What will you do now?

92
00:09:35,200--> 00:09:37,000
I don't know

93
00:09:40,700--> 00:09:42,000
Can you drive?

94
00:09:42,200--> 00:09:44,000
I can

95
00:09:45,000--> 00:09:49,000
C'mon, I will set it up for you, c'mon, c'mon

96
00:09:51,500--> 00:09:53,100
Thank you Doctor

00:09:54,300--> 00:09:56,300
these documents will suffice

98
00:10:01,900--> 00:10:05,400
Here is your letter of authority

99
00:10:08,000--> 00:10:14,000
There are all kinds of people around here,
trust is most important

100
00:10:16,000--> 00:10:22,500
We need specialists, people of courage,
but most importantly honest ones

101
00:10:27,700--> 00:10:29,000
Doctor

00:10:29,000--> 00:10:30,700
he can drive

00:10:31,000--> 00:10:34,000
maybe there is a spot for him with our group

102
00:10:35,300--> 00:10:40,000
I have a feeling that this man 
is only concerned with material matters

00:10:40,100--> 00:10:42,600
But for us, we are looking for something more

103
00:10:43,000--> 00:10:44,600
but I don't want anything more

103
00:10:45,010--> 00:10:46,800
only to make some money?

104
00:10:47,010--> 00:10:47,990
only

105
00:10:48,710--> 00:10:49,400
a lot?

106
00:10:52,510--> 00:10:53,800
as much as I can 

107
00:10:54,510--> 00:10:56,800
I am affraid we will be leaving without this man

108
00:10:56,810--> 00:10:59,800
but Doctor, he can be of use

109
00:11:00,110--> 00:11:01,500
What is your name?

110
00:11:01,510--> 00:11:02,700
Andrzej Kenig

111
00:11:02,710--> 00:11:04,800
Volksdeutsche <font size="28px">(German Collaborator)</font>?

112
00:11:03,910--> 00:11:06,500
no Way, he is our boy,
he was in the Auschwitz and Dachau

113
00:11:06,510--> 00:11:08,200
Do you have any documents?

114
00:11:08,210--> 00:11:09,200
No, I don't

115
00:11:09,810--> 00:11:10,800
anything

116
00:11:11,310--> 00:11:12,200
I don't have anything

117
00:11:12,810--> 00:11:14,400
So, how can I trust you?

118
00:11:14,410--> 00:11:16,300
I am giving you my word of honor

119
00:11:16,710--> 00:11:18,200
ahhh, ...

120
00:11:20,910--> 00:11:25,200
I think Mr. Kenig can go <font size="28px"><i>(with the rest of you)</i></font>

121
00:11:26,910--> 00:11:28,200
Lieutenant

122
00:11:29,010--> 00:11:33,000
Graustadt, in polish Siwowo

123
00:11:33,110--> 00:11:38,200
Small town located off the main highway,
no telephone service

124
00:11:38,710--> 00:11:42,200
The population was probably evacuated 
by retreating german troops

125
00:11:43,310--> 00:11:48,000
You are an operational group 
that must secure the town for repatriates

00:11:48,210--> 00:11:52,000
organize the government, activate health services

126
00:11:52,100--> 00:11:53,700
The matter is urgent, Gentlemen

00:11:54,700--> 00:11:57,700
They are sending us wounded for recovery

00:11:58,100--> 00:11:59,700
We need to put full effort into it

127
00:11:59,810--> 00:12:02,200
Well, the task is dangerous

00:12:02,510--> 00:12:06,200
there might be left over german troops in the forest

128
00:12:13,210--> 00:12:15,200
Please sign the requisition order

129
00:12:19,510--> 00:12:23,200
Gun cases are over there,
choose for yourselves

00:13:13,600--> 00:13:15,800
Kenig, ... please

139
00:13:18,000--> 00:13:20,200
Weapons to be used only 
when absolutely neccessary 

00:13:20,400--> 00:13:22,400
and in self-defense

140
00:13:34,000--> 00:13:36,100
give it to me, 
I will help you

141
00:13:39,000--> 00:13:40,000
What is it, broken?

142
00:13:40,200--> 00:13:42,300
no, sir, most likely an infection

143
00:13:42,320--> 00:13:46,800
no, sir, most likely gangrene
he's got a little scratch

144
00:13:46,920--> 00:13:48,800
Thank you very much,
I am Rozłowski

145
00:13:48,820--> 00:13:50,100
Kenig

146
00:13:50,120--> 00:13:54,000
Mister Supervisor, 
let us begin with execution of our tasks

147
00:13:54,120--> 00:13:57,000
one moment Gentlemen

148
00:13:58,420--> 00:14:00,000
maybe they are poisoned

00:14:01,000--> 00:14:03,000
the germans used to poison drinks before leaving 

149
00:14:03,220--> 00:14:05,100
I will drink your portion

150
00:14:08,000--> 00:14:11,000
Gentlemen, I wish you a few pairs of pants

00:14:11,300--> 00:14:15,000
and material benefits, within reason

151
00:14:16,020--> 00:14:19,800
for me, maybe a shirt, size 38

152
00:14:20,300--> 00:14:21,400
Most importantly

00:14:21,620--> 00:14:25,800
to re-activate health facilities
and to secure public property

153
00:14:25,820--> 00:14:27,100
Best Wishes, Gentlemen

154
00:14:27,420--> 00:14:31,800
I drink to the success of our cause

155
00:14:48,020--> 00:14:50,100
and you in a round-up? <font size="28px"><i>(caught by the Nazis)</i></font>

155
00:14:50,120--> 00:14:51,800
no, during the uprising

156
00:14:52,120--> 00:14:53,700
to <i>Kacet <font size="28px">(Concentration Camp)</font></i>?

157
00:14:53,720--> 00:14:55,600
I was lucky as it was

00:14:55,720--> 00:14:57,400
they would usually blow our guys down

00:14:57,520--> 00:15:00,000
I didn't make it across Wisła

156
00:14:53,120--> 00:14:55,400
to <i>Kacet <font size="28px">(Concentration Camp)</font></i>?

158
00:15:00,120--> 00:15:02,800
Most importantly, brother, it is to be alive

00:15:03,420--> 00:15:06,800
when I got back we broke 5 liters

159
00:15:07,020--> 00:15:08,200
And how was it for you?

160
00:15:09,320--> 00:15:10,800
Building reduced to powder

00:15:11,320--> 00:15:12,800
I started to dig

00:15:14,320--> 00:15:15,200
destroyed my pants

161
00:15:15,420--> 00:15:16,900
What for anyway?

00:15:18,220--> 00:15:19,900
let them lay there

162
00:15:21,020--> 00:15:23,800
Could we swap places?

163
00:15:24,420--> 00:15:25,400
Why?

164
00:15:25,420--> 00:15:28,500
It is windy over here and I am very sensitive

165
00:15:40,420--> 00:15:44,500
Do you want some, Aspirine, Bayer's original

165
00:15:44,820--> 00:15:45,500
No

165
00:15:46,820--> 00:15:47,500
Thank you 

166
00:15:50,320--> 00:15:58,600
Our kidneys, Mr. Kenig, are in tripple danger:
shaking, wind and dust

167
00:15:59,120--> 00:16:02,000
You can get off, you will be 'healthy like a bull'

168
00:16:02,920--> 00:16:05,700
It is said that soul is immortal

00:16:05,920--> 00:16:07,800
and body is nothing

00:16:07,920--> 00:16:12,000
dust, ... wasted waste

169
00:16:12,120--> 00:16:14,000
God helps those who help themselves

170
00:16:15,120--> 00:16:17,000
What if there are no vehicles there?

171
00:16:17,120--> 00:16:19,600
They have to be there,
they used to leave them everywhere

00:16:19,720--> 00:16:21,700
they've been without gasoline lately

172
00:18:33,120--> 00:18:35,800
Holly cow, not a soul

173
00:19:23,720--> 00:19:26,800
Damn, where did they come from

174
00:19:45,320--> 00:19:47,800
Well, why aren't you saying anything?

175
00:19:48,820--> 00:19:49,800
Poles?

176
00:19:49,920--> 00:19:51,000
kind of

176
00:19:51,220--> 00:19:52,700
What are you doing here?

177
00:19:52,720--> 00:19:54,600
We came here for a little spring picnic

178
00:19:54,820--> 00:19:56,800
And what is this, a bit of loot?

179
00:19:57,020--> 00:20:00,000
A few rags, we got the from the americans

00:20:00,420--> 00:20:02,800
We've heard it is a great place

180
00:20:03,020--> 00:20:04,900
Why great? 
Kościuszko overnighted here?

181
00:20:05,020--> 00:20:06,400
Hitler's lover

00:20:06,620--> 00:20:08,900
and she left a lot of underwear

182
00:20:09,020--> 00:20:11,900
I want to find a nice dress

183
00:20:12,020--> 00:20:13,200
That won't work my ladies

00:20:13,400--> 00:20:18,900
I am very sorry 
but we are here to protect public property

184
00:20:19,720--> 00:20:23,900
Turn around, now...now...now...now

185
00:20:28,720--> 00:20:30,700
Boss, let's take these girls

186
00:20:31,120--> 00:20:31,680
Why?

187
00:20:31,700--> 00:20:32,600
Just for fun

188
00:20:32,700--> 00:20:35,000
Without girls, it will be lame, why suffer?

189
00:20:35,010--> 00:20:37,000
Boss

190
00:20:39,010--> 00:20:41,800
Six of us, four of them, what do you think?

191
00:20:42,010--> 00:20:44,400
What does that have to do with anything?

192
00:20:46,810--> 00:20:50,700
Hey, ... you can stay

193
00:20:50,810--> 00:20:52,700
but we will have some fun, agreed?

194
00:20:52,810--> 00:20:57,300
Fantastic, last time I danced 
was at a ball in Petersburg

195
00:20:58,110--> 00:21:04,000
But I have to stress that in my group
army discipline is required, absolute obedience

196
00:21:04,010--> 00:21:06,300
I think we can make that promise

197
00:21:23,010--> 00:21:28,800
Good stuff, we did great, holy shit

198
00:21:29,010--> 00:21:30,300
Keep your mouth shut, women are present

199
00:21:30,410--> 00:21:33,800
Not to worry Director, I have a colorful resume

200
00:21:46,000--> 00:21:48,200
I will throw one more

201
00:21:48,600--> 00:21:50,000
Leave it

00:21:50,100--> 00:21:51,000
Drop it

00:21:51,500--> 00:21:53,200
and I don't want to see it again

202
00:21:53,400--> 00:21:56,400
We came here to secure this place, 
not to break windows

00:21:57,000--> 00:21:57,800
understand?

202
00:21:58,400--> 00:21:59,800
Yes sir, Doctor

203
00:22:01,600--> 00:22:02,500
Hitler

204
00:22:02,800--> 00:22:03,900
Where?

205
00:22:05,300--> 00:22:06,900
Over there, behind the window

206
00:22:40,700--> 00:22:42,480
Comb the city, women must hide

207
00:22:42,500--> 00:22:44,400
I am not hiding, I am going with you

287
00:22:44,650--> 00:22:45,000
Me too

288
00:22:45,250--> 00:22:47,800
Kenig to movie theater, Rozłowski over there

00:22:48,050--> 00:22:49,800
Smółka, Czesiek this way

00:22:49,990--> 00:22:51,400
Wijas

289
00:23:58,400--> 00:24:00,900
Please wait here

290
00:24:55,400--> 00:24:56,900
careful

291
00:25:10,400--> 00:25:11,500
He is alive

292
00:25:11,600--> 00:25:12,400
Wounded?

292
00:25:12,700--> 00:25:14,300
Drunk as a skunk

293
00:25:19,500--> 00:25:21,000
We found a German

294
00:25:33,500--> 00:25:34,900
Drunk beast

295
00:25:35,000--> 00:25:38,500
You, ... you, get up

296
00:25:40,000--> 00:25:41,500
<font color="#00FF00">Open your eyes</font>

296
00:25:42,300--> 00:25:44,500
<font color="#00FF00">Can you see us</font>

297
00:25:44,600--> 00:25:48,900
<font color="#00FF00">Wretched sun, wretched dream</font>

298
00:25:49,100--> 00:25:51,500
<font color="#00FF00">We are Polish</font>

299
00:25:59,100--> 00:26:03,500
<font color="#00FF00">Good Day Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am Schaeffer</font>

300
00:26:04,600--> 00:26:08,500
<font color="#00FF00">Reservations and service supervision 
at hotel Tivoli</font>

301
00:26:12,000--> 00:26:13,800
<font color="#00FF00">Please forgive my appearance</font>

302
00:26:14,000--> 00:26:16,800
<font color="#00FF00">Did you operate the radio?</font>

303
00:26:18,600--> 00:26:20,600
<font color="#00FF00">That is possible</font>

304
00:26:21,600--> 00:26:23,200
Are we gonna wack'em?

305
00:26:24,000--> 00:26:25,800
Will you do it?

306
00:26:26,700--> 00:26:29,800
The town was empty and it should remain empty

307
00:26:30,000--> 00:26:31,600
Take him to the hotel

308
00:26:34,700--> 00:26:37,900
<font color="#00FF00">Get up, ... GET UP!!!</font>

309
00:26:41,900--> 00:26:43,200
<font color="#00FF00">To the hotel</font>

310
00:26:49,300--> 00:26:53,200
Well Kenig, 
you can look for some pants for yourself

311
00:26:53,600--> 00:26:57,200
And you ladies can also look for some clothing

312
00:27:21,100--> 00:27:25,200
I don't know why, but I get the impression 
that I have seen you somewhere

313
00:27:27,100--> 00:27:28,200
I do appologize

314
00:27:30,600--> 00:27:31,400
Are you from Warszawa?

315
00:27:31,600--> 00:27:32,100
No

316
00:27:33,600--> 00:27:35,100
Then it was just an impression

317
00:27:36,300--> 00:27:37,800
Most certainly

318
00:27:41,000--> 00:27:43,400
Would consider living in the forest?

319
00:27:44,200--> 00:27:45,800
No

320
00:27:47,000--> 00:27:48,800
Why not?

321
00:27:50,700--> 00:27:52,500
I'd be affraid

322
00:27:57,100--> 00:28:01,200
<font color="#00FF00">I wanted to spread the rugs on the floor</font>

323
00:28:01,400--> 00:28:04,200
<font color="#00FF00">but I didn't have time</font>

324
00:28:06,400--> 00:28:09,700
<font color="#00FF00">Hard to do anything</font>

00:28:10,000--> 00:28:13,200
<font color="#00FF00">when you have too much time</font>

325
00:28:13,400--> 00:28:15,500
<font color="#00FF00">Why did you stay behind?</font>

326
00:28:15,700--> 00:28:17,800
<font color="#00FF00">I don't know, I got drunk</font>

327
00:28:18,000--> 00:28:19,900
<font color="#00FF00">What were you during your stay here?</font>

328
00:28:20,400--> 00:28:21,200
<font color="#00FF00">Nothing big</font>

00:28:22,000--> 00:28:25,200
<font color="#00FF00">I drank, opened doors, I opened almost all of them</font>

329
00:28:27,000--> 00:28:27,400
<font color="#00FF00">Please allow yourself ...</font>

330
00:28:27,410--> 00:28:29,800
<font color="#00FF00">Are there any trucks in town?</font>

331
00:28:31,510--> 00:28:32,800
<font color="#00FF00">Trucks?</font>

332
00:28:33,310--> 00:28:37,800
<font color="#00FF00">Listen, I am the new mayor here,
Understood?</font>

333
00:28:37,910--> 00:28:38,800
<font color="#00FF00">Yes sir</font>

334
00:28:39,010--> 00:28:41,700
<font color="#00FF00">I am very pleased to meet you Mister Mayor</font>

00:28:41,910--> 00:28:43,800
<font color="#00FF00">There are trucks</font>

335
00:28:45,310--> 00:28:48,300
<font color="#00FF00"> Here, the keys to the cellar at Tivoli</font>

00:28:48,710--> 00:28:51,800
<font color="#00FF00">Best supplied cellar in Graustadt</font>

336
00:29:01,310--> 00:29:06,900
I am sleeping, not a worry in the world,
I am sleeping

336
00:29:13,310--> 00:29:14,900
Take a look

338
00:29:18,310--> 00:29:19,900
Maybe you will find something for yourself

339
00:29:38,310--> 00:29:40,200
Did you find anything?

340
00:29:40,310--> 00:29:44,500
Broad with no taste, 
her waist had to be three times my size

341
00:29:44,510--> 00:29:46,900
You can take a look at this 'broad with no taste'

342
00:29:55,210--> 00:30:01,500
September last year, 
they were just finishing us off in Warszawa

343
00:30:03,610--> 00:30:07,500
Looks like her daughter 
was similar to you in size

00:30:07,810--> 00:30:09,500
You need to look in the other room

344
00:31:01,610--> 00:31:05,000
Just look at it, this is serious money

345
00:31:17,910--> 00:31:18,600
Doctor Mielecki

346
00:31:18,610--> 00:31:19,400
Yes

347
00:31:19,510--> 00:31:22,000
Doctor, I am reporting to Zielno through sanitary transport

348
00:31:22,510--> 00:31:28,000
The Supervisor is asking for a quick report 
about the condtion of the health facilities 
and that of the town

349
00:31:28,100--> 00:31:30,800
Ah, and Doctor, repatriates are waiting

350
00:31:31,100--> 00:31:33,300
Thank you, Thank you
everything will be taken care of

351
00:31:33,400--> 00:31:34,700
And when are you returning?

352
00:31:34,800--> 00:31:38,500
Ah, no, no, no, the Supervisor asks
that I remain here with you, sir

353
00:31:39,800--> 00:31:44,300
That's great, great, you will organize 
a police station here for us, right?

354
00:31:44,400--> 00:31:45,200
Will do

355
00:31:45,500--> 00:31:47,500
Well, take a room and wash yourself

356
00:31:48,800--> 00:31:53,000
It wasn't easy getting here, 
I barely found a way

357
00:31:53,100--> 00:31:55,900
Everybody hid somewhere, 
I was worried that something happened to you

00:31:56,100--> 00:31:58,100
the truck is just sitting there, nobody around

358
00:32:00,400--> 00:32:03,800
This town is great, ... yes

00:32:04,400--> 00:32:05,800
it is nice here

00:32:09,000--> 00:32:11,800
people will have ...

359
00:32:35,000--> 00:32:37,800
What did you do with yourself?

360
00:32:38,400--> 00:32:39,800
I tried to comb my hair

361
00:32:45,900--> 00:32:48,000
You look nice in this sweater

362
00:32:48,200--> 00:32:49,400
Really?

363
00:32:53,200--> 00:33:00,000
Do you not feel some kind of distaste, 
... scrupuls?

364
00:33:04,300--> 00:33:05,400
scrupuls?

365
00:33:07,300--> 00:33:12,900
Because they turned me into a beggar?
Because they took away my husband?

366
00:33:13,000--> 00:33:16,200
Tourtured, and when I was half-dead
filled my mouth with gypsium

367
00:33:17,000--> 00:33:19,200
To hell with all of their posessions

00:33:22,800--> 00:33:25,200
To hell with them all

368
00:34:09,500--> 00:34:11,000
It's funny

369
00:34:11,100--> 00:34:12,500
What?

370
00:34:13,900--> 00:34:15,100
Everything

371
00:34:19,400--> 00:34:23,380
Princely establishment 
for nouveau riche store owners

372
00:34:23,400--> 00:34:27,500
I used to visit such establishments 
at five in the morning, when I stopped caring
about the decor

373
00:34:28,400--> 00:34:30,700
Ladies, you did not forget about the our evening?

374
00:34:30,810--> 00:34:33,300
Of course not, we will be dressed to kill

375
00:34:33,500--> 00:34:35,800
Drug stores here are well supplied

376
00:34:35,810--> 00:34:38,000
We have trucks, but only three are functional

377
00:34:38,110--> 00:34:39,300
Oh, that's a measly find

378
00:34:39,410--> 00:34:40,700
but they have trailers

379
00:34:40,910--> 00:34:42,900
Mr. Kenig, please join us

380
00:34:45,210--> 00:34:48,900
Gentlemen, we are in better shape than I expected

381
00:34:49,810--> 00:34:56,800
We drink to the success of our cause, 
... to our success

382
00:35:04,010--> 00:35:08,800
Gentlemen, time to secure the property, 
bring everything of higher value to the hotel

383
00:35:08,810--> 00:35:11,800
Kenig and Smółka will inspect the shoe stores

384
00:35:12,010--> 00:35:17,300
you, photoshops and optical,
and then, in turn, the rest

385
00:35:24,010--> 00:35:26,000
Old icon, where did you find it?

386
00:35:26,010--> 00:35:27,400
In the cellar

387
00:35:28,410--> 00:35:29,400
Where there more?

388
00:35:30,110--> 00:35:33,400
They are there, really dark in there

389
00:35:33,810--> 00:35:34,800
only icons?

390
00:35:35,310--> 00:35:41,200
no, lots of pictures, but disgusting,
naked bodies together with figures of saints

391
00:35:42,310--> 00:35:43,200
Sin

392
00:35:43,410--> 00:35:44,800
and books

393
00:35:44,910--> 00:35:45,800
old?

393
00:35:45,910--> 00:35:47,900
written ...
... by hand

394
00:35:47,910--> 00:35:48,800
yeah

395
00:35:48,810--> 00:35:49,500
let's go

395
00:35:49,810--> 00:35:51,500
but, ... the shoe stores

396
00:35:51,810--> 00:35:53,100
ahh, enough time

397
00:36:21,010--> 00:36:22,400
Museum collection

398
00:36:23,010--> 00:36:24,100
What?

399
00:36:24,210--> 00:36:25,100
Museum <font size="28px'>(stuff)</font>

400
00:36:25,910--> 00:36:28,500
whatever, I am starved

401
00:36:28,610--> 00:36:29,300
me too

402
00:36:29,410--> 00:36:31,300
what is it today, Friday?

403
00:36:31,810--> 00:36:33,300
I don't know, I don't think so

404
00:36:34,310--> 00:36:39,000
that's good, 
they will cook some canned meat for us 

405
00:36:40,210--> 00:36:41,500
it's all ours

406
00:36:41,710--> 00:36:42,800
no kidding

407
00:36:43,210--> 00:36:44,800
I mean, Polish

408
00:36:45,810--> 00:36:49,800
Library in Kórnik, Warszawa

409
00:36:52,310--> 00:36:53,400
Expensive?

410
00:36:55,610--> 00:36:56,400
for sure

411
00:36:58,910--> 00:37:01,400
what is this?

412
00:37:01,910--> 00:37:04,000
illustrated script from middle ages

413
00:37:04,310--> 00:37:04,990
Expensive?

414
00:37:05,810--> 00:37:06,990
like hell

415
00:37:07,110--> 00:37:07,990
How much?

416
00:37:08,110--> 00:37:10,490
There is no price

417
00:37:10,910--> 00:37:11,990
half a million, a million?

418
00:37:12,110--> 00:37:14,490
<b>There is no price!!!</b>
a million I figure

419
00:37:14,710--> 00:37:15,790
Let me see.

419
00:37:20,710--> 00:37:22,790
And this little picture, worth a lot?

420
00:37:23,710--> 00:37:24,590
Quite a bit

421
00:37:25,110--> 00:37:26,590
So, take it

00:37:27,710--> 00:37:29,590
take the picture and will take these scribbles

422
00:37:30,810--> 00:37:31,890
Leave it

423
00:37:32,010--> 00:37:32,590
Why?

424
00:37:34,010--> 00:37:35,590
property of the nation

425
00:37:35,810--> 00:37:38,590
the nation won't suffer <font size="28px"><i>(from its loss)</i></font>

426
00:37:38,810--> 00:37:40,590
LEAVE IT !!!

427
00:37:50,010--> 00:37:51,590
Give it to me

428
00:37:52,010--> 00:37:54,590
Doctor would finish you off

00:37:55,010--> 00:37:57,590
and I will just beat the crap out of you

429
00:37:57,910--> 00:37:59,490
Put it away

430
00:38:01,710--> 00:38:03,890
inside, or it will get damaged

431
00:38:14,410--> 00:38:18,890
What's up, ... in a hurry to meet your maker

432
00:39:48,310--> 00:39:51,800
I will tell, ... I will tell Boss

433
00:39:54,810--> 00:39:56,800
Gimme a smoke

434
00:40:03,810--> 00:40:06,800
You were fighting, ... like you give a damn

435
00:40:11,810--> 00:40:13,700
Weak, ... I am still weak

436
00:40:17,010--> 00:40:19,700
Where is that damn book?

437
00:40:22,010--> 00:40:24,700
Darn, it is dark

438
00:40:27,210--> 00:40:33,700
Smółka, ... it is said 'thou shalt not steal'

439
00:40:33,710--> 00:40:35,700
So, why did you come here?

440
00:40:35,810--> 00:40:37,700
To earn some money

441
00:40:37,910--> 00:40:44,200
Well, <???> trucks if there are documents
and you are set for years

442
00:40:49,910--> 00:40:53,000
What does the Doctor want to take from here?

443
00:40:53,310--> 00:40:55,200
Whatever he can

444
00:40:55,310--> 00:40:57,200
Hospital Equipment?

445
00:40:57,210--> 00:40:58,400
Everything

446
00:40:59,810--> 00:41:01,800
And those who will come here

00:41:02,110--> 00:41:06,400
repatriots, wounded, 
what will happen with them

446
00:41:07,810--> 00:41:11,900
Just wait, you will be condemned

447
00:41:12,210--> 00:41:13,900
We are not stealing

448
00:41:15,210--> 00:41:16,900
This belongs to no one

449
00:41:17,210--> 00:41:18,800
God will remember

00:41:19,310--> 00:41:22,800
who resisted and who followed the voice of evil

450
00:41:23,010--> 00:41:25,200
Boss will rub you out

451
00:41:26,010--> 00:41:27,200
I am not alone

452
00:41:33,710--> 00:41:35,300
Who else is with you?

453
00:41:36,010--> 00:41:37,300
You are

454
00:41:40,010--> 00:41:41,300
I am?

455
00:41:43,010--> 00:41:44,300
And who else?

456
00:41:46,010--> 00:41:47,300
Czesiek

457
00:41:52,410--> 00:41:54,300
Where is my hat?

458
00:42:07,410--> 00:42:10,300
Boss promissed to get me an absolution

459
00:42:11,410--> 00:42:12,800
Smółka

460
00:42:15,010--> 00:42:17,800
Nah, I have to ask Boss

461
00:42:18,710--> 00:42:20,800
You won't tell him anything

462
00:42:28,710--> 00:42:32,800
Damnation, ... dark

463
00:42:33,510--> 00:42:35,300
<i>... two bottles</i>

00:42:35,310--> 00:42:43,100
<i>I feel it
Who says I do not feel it
Head's buzzing, vaporizing
World's turning like a housefly
</i>

00:42:43,110--> 00:42:48,800
<i>Whiskey, who says we don't drink Whiskey
And now you drunken mugs
What will be drinking next
</i>

00:42:48,710--> 00:42:49,400
<i>Rum</i>

00:42:49,710--> 00:42:56,800
<i>Rum, we'll drink by glasses rum
For even bigger buzz, for even louder noise

00:42:57,110--> 00:43:03,800
<i>Rum, we'll be drinking damned rum
Till dawn, till sleep will take its hold, that deadly chum
</i>

00:43:04,510--> 00:43:10,800
<i>Cognac, so how about some Cognac,
That temple smashing hammer, 
true aromatic gold</i>

00:43:11,210--> 00:43:17,800
<i>golden, so what that it is golden
when blood simmers from longing
earth has enough of gold
</i>

00:43:18,210--> 00:43:24,800
<i>Wine, rivers flowing with wine
Children, let them drink wine, 
wine only gets you down 
</i>

00:43:26,210--> 00:43:32,800
<i>Gin we will drink, murderous gin
hang ups leave with a spin 
let it torch devil's heir

00:43:29,610--> 00:43:31,100
<font color="#00FF00">silly story</font>

00:43:33,210--> 00:43:36,800
<i>Gin we will drink, murderous gin
...
</i>

00:43:37,210--> 00:43:39,000
Why are you laughing?

00:43:39,210--> 00:43:41,100
<font size="28px">(smiling)</font> to you

00:43:42,210--> 00:43:56,100
<i>There is one and one only

00:43:57,210--> 00:44:01,800

00:44:12,810--> 00:44:18,100

<font color="#00FF00">Not a single clean glass</font>

00:44:18,510--> 00:44:20,800
Alcohol disinfects

00:44:21,510--> 00:44:23,800
Can you take a good look at her, will you

00:44:24,510--> 00:44:25,500
sure

00:44:25,910--> 00:44:27,500
I have it hooked up with her

00:44:28,510--> 00:44:29,500
congrats

00:44:29,910--> 00:44:32,700
By any chance, would you know 
if cibazol works preventively

00:44:32,780--> 00:44:34,900
I don't know, why not ask the doctor

00:44:36,180--> 00:44:38,300
He is a Doctor the way I am a Minister

00:44:39,780--> 00:44:41,900
How so, what about the documents?

00:44:42,080--> 00:44:44,300
Documents, ... maybe you need some?

00:44:53,880--> 00:44:55,300
Doctor, ...

00:44:58,480--> 00:44:59,400
Quiet

00:45:00,480--> 00:45:01,400
I have a proposition

00:45:01,780--> 00:45:02,800
What is it?

00:45:03,780--> 00:45:05,300
Lots to talk about

00:45:05,480--> 00:45:08,400
Quit wrecking the mood, brother, leave it

00:45:09,980--> 00:45:11,300
You are scared

00:45:11,380--> 00:45:12,400
You drank too much

00:45:12,980--> 00:45:13,800
You are scared

00:45:14,080--> 00:45:15,400
Yeah, yeah

00:45:19,580--> 00:45:21,400
<font color="#00FF00">Where is the post office?</font>

00:45:21,500--> 00:45:22,800
<font color="#00FF00">On the Post street</font>

00:45:23,500--> 00:45:27,800
<font color="#00FF00">Go to the square and turn right 
then take the first left</font>

00:45:28,500--> 00:45:33,800
Listen, occupy Smółka with a conversation, ok?
I will be right back

00:45:47,500--> 00:45:49,800
<font size="28px">I won't drink vodka, no</font>

00:45:55,500--> 00:45:57,800
Will you have a drink with me?

00:45:58,500--> 00:45:59,800
I can have a drink

00:46:02,200--> 00:46:07,800
What is your name?
..., I know, I know, Hanka

00:46:08,200--> 00:46:10,800
I've been watching you since the morning

00:46:19,500--> 00:46:22,800
I won't be like that, I will respect you

00:46:23,200--> 00:46:25,000
You won't be unhappy with me

00:46:28,200--> 00:46:33,800
we will have a farm, money,
you will buy anything you want

00:46:34,200--> 00:46:36,400
Money is of no interest to me

00:46:38,500--> 00:46:40,600
Andrzej told you this

00:46:41,900--> 00:46:45,800
heavenly kingdom, he says, 
will belong to the poor

00:47:58,700--> 00:48:01,100
And where is our professor?

00:48:01,300--> 00:48:02,600
Where is Mr. Kenig?

00:48:04,500--> 00:48:05,800
Probably went to bed

00:48:06,000--> 00:48:07,800
Oh, alone?

00:48:08,100--> 00:48:09,800
<font color="#00FF00">Mister Mayor</font>

00:48:10,600--> 00:48:13,800
<font color="#00FF00">Are you asking about Mr. Kenig?</font>

00:48:13,800--> 00:48:14,200
<font color="#00FF00">Yes</font>

00:48:14,210--> 00:48:15,800
<font color="#00FF00">Professor went to the Post Office</font>

00:48:16,200--> 00:48:17,200
<font color="#00FF00">What?</font>

00:48:19,200--> 00:48:20,580
Czesiek

00:48:21,700--> 00:48:23,280
Czesiek !!!

00:48:24,900--> 00:48:26,680
Kenig went to the Post Office

00:48:31,300--> 00:48:33,480
Hallo, ... hallo

00:48:33,500--> 00:48:34,980
<font color="blue">Yes, hallo</font>

00:48:35,200--> 00:48:36,480
Hallo, Zielno?

00:48:36,500--> 00:48:41,080
<font color="blue">No, Korzów, where did you connect from?
go on ... go on, hallo</font>

00:48:41,200--> 00:48:43,880
Could I speak with the Supervisor in Zielno?

00:48:43,900--> 00:48:48,880
<font color="blue">Unfortunately no, 
maybe you want to connect with Poznań
or Warszawa, I have those lines open</font>

00:48:48,900--> 00:48:51,880
<font color="blue">Hallo, can you hear me, hallo</font>

00:48:52,100--> 00:48:53,880
Connect me with police in Gorzów 

00:48:54,100--> 00:48:55,380
<font color="blue">Are you a criminal?</font>

00:48:55,400--> 00:48:58,880
Yes, and will start shooting 
if you don't connect me immediately

00:48:59,000--> 00:49:01,480
<font color="blue">I will try, rigth away</font>

00:49:06,400--> 00:49:07,280
Hallo

00:49:09,880--> 00:49:10,480
Hallo !!!

00:49:10,500--> 00:49:15,480
<font color="blue">Yes, can you hear it, no one is responding
they maybe on patrol, apparently something happened</font>

00:49:15,600--> 00:49:17,080
<font color="blue">
Sure you don't want to connect with Warszawa?</font>

00:49:17,100--> 00:49:20,000
Some other time, 
now please listen to me carefully

00:49:20,020--> 00:49:20,780
<font color="blue">Yes</font>

00:49:21,100--> 00:49:28,380
You must inform the Supervisor 
or police in Zielno, that Kenig was calling 

00:49:28,800--> 00:49:29,880
<font color="blue">Kenig</font>

00:49:29,900--> 00:49:32,380
Yes, Kenig from Siwowo

00:49:33,100--> 00:49:37,780
The town is in good shape, 
but they must send people with machine guns

00:49:37,800--> 00:49:38,180
<font color="blue">Yes</font>

00:49:38,200--> 00:49:39,180
Did you understand me?

00:49:39,200--> 00:49:41,580
<font color="blue">I understood, are you in danger?, ... hallo</font>

00:49:43,200--> 00:49:44,180
Hallo

00:49:44,200--> 00:49:45,580
<font color="blue">Are you in danger?</font>

00:49:45,800--> 00:49:49,780
I don't know, oh, one more thing, 
nobody knows about this call,
Good Night

00:49:49,800--> 00:49:50,580
<font color="blue">Good Night</font>

00:50:16,800--> 00:50:21,780
Talk, ... you see, nobody here

00:50:22,200--> 00:50:23,780
The kraut bullshited

00:50:42,200--> 00:50:44,380
There is signal, damn

00:50:45,600--> 00:50:47,380
We gotta have the whole thing ...

00:51:02,300--> 00:51:04,180
What is this foolin' around?

00:51:04,600--> 00:51:05,780
I am practicing

00:51:12,400--> 00:51:13,780
I am shooting the bottles

00:51:14,000--> 00:51:15,880
Easy, quit those stupid pranks

00:51:15,900--> 00:51:18,280
Were you at the Post Office?

00:51:19,800--> 00:51:21,680
at the Post Office, what for?

00:51:21,700--> 00:51:25,380
man, can you shoot, holly cow, 
where did you learn it?

00:51:25,800--> 00:51:27,380
in the resistance

00:51:26,800--> 00:51:28,380
what were you doing there

00:51:28,400--> 00:51:28,980
where?

00:51:31,300--> 00:51:33,080
in the resistance

00:51:35,300--> 00:51:36,780
everything

00:51:36,800--> 00:51:39,080
and discipline, didn't they theach you there

00:51:40,300--> 00:51:43,180
I beg your pardon, but I do not understand

00:51:43,600--> 00:51:46,080
I will explain it to you

00:51:49,500--> 00:51:51,380
You see 

00:51:52,500--> 00:51:57,380
without talented people, we can even get by 

00:51:58,600--> 00:52:04,080
We only need those who are obedient

00:52:10,100--> 00:52:12,080
and how much am I going to get for it

00:52:13,700--> 00:52:15,480
for what?

00:52:17,200--> 00:52:19,480
let's say, for being obedient

00:52:27,800--> 00:52:30,180
enough for a pair of pants

00:52:35,200--> 00:52:39,180
I am affraid you underestimate me

00:52:42,200--> 00:52:45,380
ten percent, Kenig, hmm?

00:52:49,000--> 00:52:52,380
of the whole thing

00:52:55,000--> 00:52:58,380
Will we have to run away abroad?

00:53:00,000--> 00:53:02,380
not out of the question

00:53:02,700--> 00:53:07,380
now I am beginnig to worry
that you overestimate me

00:53:09,500--> 00:53:13,380
I want to earn as much as I can
because I don't have anything

00:53:13,800--> 00:53:21,080
but on the way here I didn't expect
we would get this far

00:53:22,800--> 00:53:31,380
Doctor, ... I've grown to like this place
I would like to stay here

00:53:36,800--> 00:53:37,880
forever?

00:53:42,800--> 00:53:45,880
you make a career

00:53:48,400--> 00:53:50,000
Doctor

00:53:54,800--> 00:54:00,080
will you give me a bit of time to think

00:54:00,700--> 00:54:03,400
whole night ahead of us

00:54:09,600--> 00:54:19,880
<i>Where are you now? 
What kind of slave you ...</i>

00:54:22,600--> 00:54:36,880
<font size="24px">
... east has some kind of connection
with the proponents of metapsychosis
telepathy and reincarnation of souls
anyway, a there was a similar case in Kraków
I remember one of the professors invited us ...</font>

00:54:41,000--> 00:54:46,880
don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, DON'T CRY !!!

00:54:47,000--> 00:54:48,880
leave me alone

00:55:07,600--> 00:55:09,080
Where is Anna?

00:55:09,100--> 00:55:12,380
I dunno, she doesn't want me

00:55:12,400--> 00:55:13,880
why?

00:55:15,000--> 00:55:16,880
<font color="#00FF00">you snitch</font>

00:55:29,100--> 00:55:30,880
What are you doing here?

00:55:31,000--> 00:55:32,480
I ran away from Smółka

00:55:34,000--> 00:55:42,480
wants to get married
promisses a farm and respect, he's very nice

00:55:44,000--> 00:55:45,880
you know it's funny

00:55:46,600--> 00:55:51,880
but in the camp,
sometimes when I used to think about freedom

00:55:52,000--> 00:55:55,880
my dreams would hover around something like that

00:55:56,800--> 00:55:58,900
I didn't dare to expect anything

00:56:07,600--> 00:56:09,280
he will tell him now

00:56:09,400--> 00:56:10,880
what?

00:56:13,100--> 00:56:15,880
Andrzej, what is going on here?

00:56:18,500--> 00:56:20,880
well, make it short

00:56:21,500--> 00:56:27,180
Boss, those medical contraptions, 
we shouldn't be taking them

00:56:28,900--> 00:56:30,480
Who told you this?

00:56:30,600--> 00:56:32,900
nobody, I by myself

00:56:34,900--> 00:56:35,880
Kenig, eh?

00:56:36,000--> 00:56:40,400
Not Kenig, what does he understand?
he just wants to earn a lot

00:56:40,500--> 00:56:41,800
you didn't figure it out by yourself !!!

00:56:41,880--> 00:56:45,100
what, do you think that I am nothing

00:56:45,180--> 00:56:46,880
I also have my own mind
NO !!!

00:56:47,000--> 00:56:48,480
exagerration

00:56:52,800--> 00:56:59,480
Doctor, ... sin, ... this is for the wounded

00:56:59,600--> 00:57:05,080
Smółka, don't rack your brains over this
it is not for you

00:57:05,600--> 00:57:09,480
Listen only to me, you will be better off

00:57:10,200--> 00:57:14,080
You will have money, you will build a house

00:57:16,000--> 00:57:20,080
you will buy a pair of horses, cows, plow

00:57:21,200--> 00:57:22,080
motor bike

00:57:22,200--> 00:57:26,080
and a motor bike, you will live

00:57:26,400--> 00:57:29,780
you will live, like a count

00:57:30,900--> 00:57:35,680
no, those contraptions must not be taken

00:57:36,000--> 00:57:37,880
buddy, go to bed, you are drunk

00:57:37,900--> 00:57:41,080
THOSE CONTRAPTIONS MUST NOT BE TAKEN !!! 

00:57:41,700--> 00:57:45,480
It is said 'thou shalt not steal', right?

00:57:44,580--> 00:57:46,680
you are right

00:57:48,180--> 00:57:50,680
you are right

00:57:51,180--> 00:57:55,680
but it is also said 'thou shalt not kill'

00:57:56,180--> 00:57:57,680
yes

00:58:00,880--> 00:58:03,680
and, what have you got there?

00:58:05,180--> 00:58:06,680
a pistol

00:58:07,880--> 00:58:10,680
for killing?

00:58:22,780--> 00:58:25,280
... must not be taken ...

00:58:25,780--> 00:58:30,880
ok, ok, ok, buddy, go to your room,
get some sleep

00:58:45,780--> 00:58:47,880
I can't, I can't

00:59:37,180--> 00:59:40,080
and it was going to be such a joyous evening

00:59:44,180--> 00:59:48,080
where did they go, all those wonderful men

00:59:48,480--> 00:59:52,080
where is my neighbourhood, where is that street?

00:59:52,100--> 00:59:55,080
where is that house?

00:59:55,880--> 00:59:59,080
you always carry on about this Petersburg

01:00:00,080--> 01:00:02,080
I've never been there

01:00:07,480--> 01:00:09,800
I am Dubikowska from the Lublin area

01:00:10,000--> 01:00:13,080
with my husband, 
we danced away a few beautiful farms

01:00:21,080--> 01:00:26,080
didn't work out, no keys to the car
and other vehicles are without gas

01:00:27,080--> 01:00:28,080
careful

01:01:04,780--> 01:01:06,080
we are posting guards, 
Czesiek

01:01:06,780--> 01:01:08,880
you will guard the hall till 3:00am 
then wake up Wijas

01:01:09,180--> 01:01:10,780
the last one on duty Rudłowski

01:01:10,800--> 01:01:12,780
and what about Smółka, he is a Saint?

01:01:12,800--> 01:01:14,080
drunk, he is sleeping

01:01:14,180--> 01:01:15,580
are you excluding me?

01:01:15,680--> 01:01:19,580
I don't wish to deprive Ms. Anna of your company

01:01:20,280--> 01:01:24,580
Just in case, it is safer to not leave the hotel, please

01:01:24,680--> 01:01:27,580
I wish you, ladies and gentlemen, a good night

01:01:52,680--> 01:01:56,580
I found a stamp collection, should we take a look?

01:02:01,980--> 01:02:04,580
in bed?

01:02:06,680--> 01:02:08,580
What is your room number?

01:02:09,280--> 01:02:10,180
149

01:02:15,280--> 01:02:17,180
wait there

01:02:28,280--> 01:02:30,180
we wanted to look at the moon

01:02:30,280--> 01:02:31,880
what's so interesting about it

01:02:32,080--> 01:02:33,180
that it's so pale

01:02:33,480--> 01:02:35,180
surely from fear

01:02:35,480--> 01:02:37,880
I congratulate the young couple

01:02:38,080--> 01:02:40,180
you are very nice, although silent

01:02:40,380--> 01:02:43,880
you have no idea what a chore it is
to listen to all of that

01:02:44,580--> 01:02:45,580
enjoy yourselves

01:02:46,580--> 01:02:47,580
Janka

01:02:49,580--> 01:02:51,580
will you do something for me?

01:02:51,780--> 01:02:53,880
for you anything

01:02:53,900--> 01:02:58,180
you must somehow get out of here,
but please continue smiling at me, ok

01:03:00,200--> 01:03:05,180
you will go to the Post Office right from the square,
then the first cross street to the left

01:03:07,200--> 01:03:08,180
and then

01:03:08,200--> 01:03:14,180
from there you will make a phone call to wherever,
and, in my name, request that they send police

01:03:14,800--> 01:03:16,980
phone office is on the second floor

01:03:17,500--> 01:03:20,180
but we are the only two who know about it

01:03:24,800--> 01:03:27,080
Can't you make up your mind?

01:03:30,300--> 01:03:32,380
I've sent Janka to the Post Office

01:03:32,600--> 01:03:33,880
maybe she will make a connection

01:03:34,100--> 01:03:36,080
go to your room

01:03:37,000--> 01:03:39,880
I will try to get through to Czesiek

01:03:40,000--> 01:03:41,280
Andrzej

01:03:44,400--> 01:03:46,380
leave them 

01:03:57,500--> 01:03:59,080
when are we leaving?

01:04:00,100--> 01:04:01,880
at the break of dawn

01:04:08,100--> 01:04:10,080
I am not going

01:04:14,600--> 01:04:16,080
I want to stay here

01:04:16,700--> 01:04:18,580
What are you expecting here?

01:04:19,500--> 01:04:22,080
normal life

01:04:23,500--> 01:04:25,180
here?

01:04:25,900--> 01:04:27,880
yes, here

01:04:29,400--> 01:04:33,880
and that's why I won't let anyone 
take anything from here

01:04:36,400--> 01:04:38,880
who are you saying this to, eh? 

01:04:38,900--> 01:04:40,000
to you

01:04:40,500--> 01:04:42,480
because I am expecting you will help me

01:04:42,500--> 01:04:44,280
what planet did you fall from,
you idiot

01:04:44,300--> 01:04:46,380
for 3 years in the camp I was eating turnips

01:04:46,400--> 01:04:49,880
I told myself, once it is over, if I survive
I will be somebody, you understand?

01:04:50,000--> 01:04:51,680
now I have the right to take everything

01:04:51,700--> 01:04:52,880
from whom? 

01:04:53,800--> 01:04:57,980
tomorrow will arrive bunch of beggars like you and I

01:04:58,200--> 01:05:00,480
at least they should get what is here

01:05:00,500--> 01:05:03,780
I did my thinking about the fatherland during the war 
now I am thinking about myself

01:05:04,300--> 01:05:08,380
I want to have money, a house, a woman

01:05:15,400--> 01:05:17,480
I would like to fall in love

01:05:37,000--> 01:05:42,480
and you donkey, walk in your ragged pants
and quit stirring the pot or you might get it

01:05:57,200--> 01:05:59,000
I will get it

01:06:02,000--> 01:06:03,000
Where were you tramping around? 

01:06:03,000--> 01:06:04,800
Eh, watch your language, mister handsome

01:06:05,000--> 01:06:06,600
and keep your hands to yourself

01:06:06,800--> 01:06:09,100
you lock me out and then throw an argument

01:06:09,200--> 01:06:10,000
go to sleep

01:06:10,010--> 01:06:12,400
with pleasure, Good Night

01:06:12,500--> 01:06:15,400
someone must have been there, phone is broken

01:06:23,500--> 01:06:27,400
Mister, how do you do it?

01:06:27,800--> 01:06:29,900
I promise marriage

01:06:37,000--> 01:06:39,000
I know everything

01:06:44,400--> 01:06:47,600
Yes, I know everything

01:06:48,500--> 01:06:54,000
I will tell you how to take women

01:06:54,500--> 01:06:56,700
Mister, without a sentiment

01:06:57,200--> 01:07:03,200
if you sprinkle more you get more,
you sprinke less then, well, you know

01:07:03,280--> 01:07:05,900
You gotta have something to sprinkle

01:07:06,000--> 01:07:07,900
You think that a girl did a number on me?

01:07:09,000--> 01:07:10,400
Never

01:07:12,000--> 01:07:13,700
I could also roll like you

01:07:14,400--> 01:07:17,800
meander like a romantic, that poet Mickiewicz

01:07:18,100--> 01:07:19,800
But what for?

01:07:20,000--> 01:07:23,800
Why do you wear gloves?

01:07:24,000--> 01:07:26,800
eh ..., I have, you see, ugly hands, and ...

01:07:27,280--> 01:07:28,400
Good Night, sir

01:07:32,280--> 01:07:33,800
Good Night

01:07:39,880--> 01:07:42,400
It looks like I am on my own

01:07:42,580--> 01:07:44,800
I expected that

01:07:47,080--> 01:07:48,800
What will you do?

01:07:50,000--> 01:07:51,100
I don't know

01:07:51,400--> 01:07:53,700
I beg you leave it all

01:07:54,900--> 01:07:57,300
What time is it?

01:08:00,500--> 01:08:01,700
almost break of dawn 

01:08:02,900--> 01:08:06,000
I am affraid that police doesn't know 
anything about us

01:08:06,400--> 01:08:08,800
You did all you could

01:08:11,000--> 01:08:13,800
clearly, you won't stop them all by yourself

01:08:17,500--> 01:08:18,800
I don't know

01:08:19,000--> 01:08:20,000
Andrzej

01:08:22,000--> 01:08:23,100
I am affraid

01:08:24,500--> 01:08:26,800
Can't you understand that?

01:08:37,000--> 01:08:39,000
I am hoping I will manage somehow

01:08:39,100--> 01:08:41,000
AND I DON'T WANT THAT!!!

01:08:42,700--> 01:08:44,800
I don't want that, understand?

01:08:47,100--> 01:08:50,800
I was thinking I would regain my peace

01:08:52,100--> 01:08:55,800
Can't you see what they turned me into?
I am affraid

01:08:56,100--> 01:08:59,000
I've been affraid for six years,
everyday

01:08:59,500--> 01:09:07,000
I despise those macho faces of yours,
those guns of yours, all this heroism

01:09:07,010--> 01:09:11,800
That's why I need to purge this trash,
to regain peace

01:09:12,510--> 01:09:16,900
I also have to learn to believe 
that one can live honestly

01:09:23,010--> 01:09:24,900
Anna

01:09:25,010--> 01:09:26,900
leave me

01:09:29,610--> 01:09:31,600
leave me

01:09:46,910--> 01:09:52,600
<font color="#00FF00">I am not a snitch, professor
Mayor is Mayor, we need to obey authorities</font>

01:09:53,610--> 01:09:57,200
<font color="#00FF00">Mielecki is no Mayor
Understand? !!!</font>

01:10:03,810--> 01:10:05,900
<font color="#00FF00">Oh my dear God</font>

01:10:35,010--> 01:10:35,900
Anna?

01:11:01,510--> 01:11:03,000
Are you angry with me?

01:12:02,410--> 01:12:04,000
They are leaving

01:12:05,410--> 01:12:06,700
and you?

01:12:07,410--> 01:12:08,700
I am staying

01:12:10,410--> 01:12:11,700
Where are you going?

01:12:21,910--> 01:12:23,700
get something to eat

01:12:23,710--> 01:12:24,700
<font color="#00FF00">Professor</font>

01:12:24,910--> 01:12:25,700
<font color="#00FF00">I am hungry</font>

01:12:25,910--> 01:12:27,700
<font color="#00FF00">Professor, I would like to show you something</font>

01:12:27,910--> 01:12:29,700
<font color="#00FF00">You are drunk again</font>

01:12:29,910--> 01:12:32,700
<font color="#00FF00">I am not drunk, follow me</font>

01:12:40,410--> 01:12:43,700
get ready girls, we are leaving soon

01:13:22,010--> 01:13:24,700
<font color="#00FF00">What am I supposed to do with it, Professor</font>

01:13:47,010--> 01:13:48,200
Andrzej

01:13:48,610--> 01:13:50,000
Andrzej !!!

01:13:56,210--> 01:14:01,000
Antek, ... Smółka, ... SMÓŁKA !!!

01:14:24,810--> 01:14:26,400
It had to hurt

01:14:26,810--> 01:14:28,600
punctured lungs

01:14:28,910--> 01:14:30,600
This is horrible, let's get out of here

01:14:30,910--> 01:14:32,600
Who did this?

01:14:32,910--> 01:14:35,900
I don't know, I don't know anything,
I was sleeping all that time

01:14:37,910--> 01:14:41,000
They are bandits, we have to stop them

01:14:41,010--> 01:14:42,200
but why me?

01:14:42,400--> 01:14:44,400
so you can look at your face in the mirror

01:14:44,510--> 01:14:45,900
they will kill us, I don't want to

01:14:46,210--> 01:14:48,400
I don't know anything, I don't know any...

01:14:58,510--> 01:15:03,400
You won't let them get away with it, right,
you will arrest them, call the police

01:15:13,010--> 01:15:15,000
Doctor

01:15:15,310--> 01:15:18,000
I agree to the terms, I am coming with you

01:15:18,010--> 01:15:20,000
Right, I understand it

01:15:20,110--> 01:15:21,400
come down

01:15:22,110--> 01:15:26,000
What is the meaning of this, Doctor,
apparently you don't wont to take us with you

01:15:26,010--> 01:15:31,400
Unfortunately, dear lady, the contract has expired,
this is where we part ways, Good Bye

01:15:29,800--> 01:15:30,300
but ... 

01:15:31,410--> 01:15:32,400
Which truck?

01:15:32,410--> 01:15:32,900

01:15:38,010--> 01:15:38,900

01:15:39,010--> 01:15:39,900
Which truck are you taking?

01:15:40,410--> 01:15:41,400
Opel

01:16:05,010--> 01:16:08,000
Good Bye, ... beauties

01:17:07,510--> 01:17:11,000
Mielecki, step away from the trucks

01:17:12,510--> 01:17:15,000
Step away from the trucks

01:17:17,010--> 01:17:19,000
Hide, God dam'it !!!

01:17:19,310--> 01:17:22,000

01:21:07,880--> 01:21:08,700

01:21:27,510--> 01:21:29,100
Block the streets

01:21:37,010--> 01:21:44,100
Enough shooting, go away, leave the town, 
you hear me, enough shooting

01:23:00,010--> 01:23:03,800
And was it all worth it, Kenig?

01:23:04,010--> 01:23:09,900
I told you, without talented people we can get by

01:23:12,510--> 01:23:17,100
we only need obedient ones

01:25:50,010--> 01:25:53,100
Mielecki is dead, don't shoot

01:25:56,010--> 01:25:58,800

01:28:05,410--> 01:28:07,700
You murderer

01:28:12,410--> 01:28:14,700

God Damn, we got your message too late

01:29:49,410--> 01:29:52,100
But I see you've managed

01:29:52,410--> 01:29:54,700
You've accomplished a great feat

01:30:03,110--> 01:30:06,200
I killed, ... three

01:30:06,810--> 01:30:07,700
In self-defense

01:30:11,810--> 01:30:13,500
I am not sure

01:30:13,610--> 01:30:16,000
Defending public property

01:30:16,610--> 01:30:23,000
Supervisor wants you to become ... a Mayor here

01:30:27,110--> 01:30:28,500
I have to leave this place

01:30:28,710--> 01:30:30,300

01:30:33,310--> 01:30:35,300
I have to leave

01:30:37,410--> 01:30:38,400
Give him a ride
