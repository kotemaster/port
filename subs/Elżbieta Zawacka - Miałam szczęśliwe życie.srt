00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,000
It was a good life

00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:08,600
I feel I had a happy life

00:00:9,300 --> 00:00:13,000
Sure, it had moments of regret

00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,700
not having your own family

00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,500
not having your own children

00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,000
but that is how it happened

00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,600
the cause was more important than the rest

00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,400
and that is how life unfolded 

00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
so, my life was good

00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,000
and I wish this life to many people

00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,700
does one wish to have a long life?

00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,000
I feel I've been living for a little too long

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,000
but yes, 96 years, you will cut this

00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,800
sometimes you feel like you don't want to live

00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
it is enough

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,700
but I still feel I will do something

00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,800
those two tasks, I have to finish them

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,800
I simply cannnot surrender

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,800
I often have to force myself

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,000
but if you have an objective in life 
that you have to accomplish 

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,000
then you have a will to live and life is joyous

00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,800
that's how I think it is

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,400
I was always Elizabeth (Elżbieta)

00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,000
In France I was know as Elise Riviere

00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:50,900
and as Elisabeth Brownet 
I went all the way to Denmark
to Flensburg

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,900
In England I was never Elżbieta Zawacka

00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,900
but always Elizabeth Watson

00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,900
you see, so there I am Watson

00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:08,900
and this attached itself to me, 
I knew my own legend, who I was
as Elise Riviere or Kubica

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,400
I completely stopped being Elżbieta Zawacka

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,400
I was a courier from the very beginning
of the occupation

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,400
Consequently, I really know all kinds of tricks
for crossing the border.

00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,500
I've made over 100 border crossings

00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,500
so, I had to have my ways 
that is your own sense

00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,200
I knew which story to tell to each border guard

00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,500
I was as fluent in German as I was in Polish 

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,500
since I was born in Toruń

00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,900
a city that was completely germanized

00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,300
My father was a government official 

00:02:53,600 --> 00:03:00,000
if Polish was spoken in his family home
and police would report this

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,400
he would not be able to continue 
as a government official

00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,000
he would have a job

00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,000
so, at home only German was spoken

00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,000
if it became known
that any of the children spoke Polish

00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,000
that would have been unacceptable

00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,800
we had to speak German

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,800
when Pomerania was reunited with Poland

00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Arrival of (gen.) Haller, ceremonial arrival
which affected me so much emotionally

00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,800
which affected my whole familly so strongly
arrival of Haller in Toruń

00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:41,800
at that time I didn't speak Polish
so I had to attend a German school in Poland

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,800
since I didn't speak Polish

00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:56,200
I remember my joy, when, having learned Polish,
I passed an exam to a Polish gymnasium

00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01,700
and I found out that I would be studying Latin 

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,500
that was a dream come true,
'I would be studying Latin'

00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,800
Funny, isn't it, my brothers studied Latin

00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:21,000
I finished that Polish gymnasiusm 
and I new right away I would study Mathematics

00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:28,000
Prof. Krygowski was my academic advisor
when I was working on my Masters Thesis

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:36,300
Krygowski was this famous porfessor 
at the university who had 3 assitants

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,990
Rejewski was already the senior assistant 
of Krygowski

00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:46,090
I was conducting my Mathematical exercises 
and seminars with them

00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:54,090
They were already involved in military service
working on cryptography needed by the army

00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,090
They were already working for the army

00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,890
We didn't know this

00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,890
I know that the war would have lasted longer
if it wasn't for his Enigma

00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:10,890
During my last year of university I've 
experienced the most important event of my life

00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,890
I joined military trainig for women

00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:22,090
Since that time I had two services 
to which I devoted my energies

00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:31,890
It was my professional work as a teacher
and social work as an military instructor 
responsible for combat training of women

00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:39,890
It was called, in short, 'PWK'
We were preparing for military service, 
as we knew that war was inevitable

00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:49,090
I was involved in war preparations since
December 1930

00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:56,590
Two years before the war
I took a leave from my teaching job

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:05,090
and I solely focused 
on military preparation of women
as a commander of Silesia region

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,790
It was a large region, 19 counties
there was a need for trainig of all detachments
and so on

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,890
It was beautiful work

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,090
There were so many friendships which 
you couldn't find anywhere else

00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:24,090
because they were all so passionate,
participants of women's combat training

00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:29,090
There were so many teachers, 
fully devoted to service

00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:40,090
I am asking myself a question:
'Was it worth all it?'
as the service was often very demanding
it would happen like that

00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:49,090
But it's not enough to say 'It was worth it'
It gave us so much joy, 
I lived so joyously during this service

00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:05,890
My service in conspiracy, my military service 
began on Krucza 12 

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:17,090
I remember standing with Magda Zawodzińska, 
Karasiówna joined us and 
I repeat after her the words of the oath

00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:22,090
I had a friend whom I initiated with the oath,
Teresa ???

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:32,090
After the war she told me that she included
the words of the oath in her daily prayer,
morning and evening

00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:41,090
??? established a section, we called it the pan,
abroad

00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:49,090
We had our own cells, I had one in Katowice
I called it 'the circus' 

00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:59,090
The one in Berlin, I called it 'Sabina'
Sabina was a co-worker of Jakubianiec

00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:05,990
who worked for Poland in Japanese embassy

00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,990
transferring reports to Sweden

00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,990
that was one of our pen-cells

00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,990
Here in Pomerania there was a cell
beautiful, 'Danusia' 

00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:22,990
which was transferring people to Sweden

00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:29,990
It was made easier for me to create cells abroad

00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,290
what was it?

00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,090
It is very interesting.

00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:41,090
Before the war I used to teach in Silesia
as a teacher of Mathematics

00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:46,000
I used to teach in Tarnowskie Brzegi
Tarnowskie Głógi

00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,090
There I functioned as a commander of PWK,
teacher of Mathematics

00:08:51,400 --> 00:09:01,090
And there, near the public school was another school
called 'Lyceum of Raciborzanki'

00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:10,090
It was a Polish school for polish girls,
daughter of Poles with German citizenship

00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:20,090
And I, since I knew German equally as well as Polish,
and their Polish was not always up to par,
so the language was necessary

00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:25,090
I was also teaching at the school of Raciborzanki

00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,090
I would conduct discussion groups, 
organize school trips, etc.

00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,090
We became very close

00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:39,090
All Raciborzanki girls lived along the Rhein,
in Berlin, other places

00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:45,090
So, during the War I was able to use them

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,490
I would often go to Berlin in these matters

00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,290
AK (Homeland Army) needed money

00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,490
How do you deliver money from London?

00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,890
It was done like this:

00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,490
London would transfer money to a bank in Sweden

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Swedish bank would transfer it to Berlin
and I would get it from Berlin for AK

00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:17,490
So, there was a friendly, our, official, 
naturally covert

00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:25,490
who would take the money from the bank,
take it to doctor Ivo

00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,490
I would arrive at his place,
he bought me a ...,

00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:35,490
Well, we needed to transport it somehow,
it had to be cash, and cash takes a lot of space

00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,500
It was a lot of money

00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,000
I remember we bought a big suit case

00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,890
from the war period, cheap one, not leather

00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:49,890
and I would take it across the border
with that money

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,700
I never took the train directly to Warszawa
through Poznań, let's say, 

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Gestapo could have recognized me
if I was travelling too often

00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
So, on the night train, during the curfew
I arrive in Sosnowiec

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Come to the right address

00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
My sister, Klara, lived there  

00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:22,000
I arrive, and, I would always give her a signal
by throwing a pebble at her window, 
she lived on the second floor

00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,000
the whole thing had to follow rules of consipracy

00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,000
because I never knew whether I was being followed

00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I signal my arrival with a pebble, but nothing, 
it is dark, she is not there, what is going on?

00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,000
I am with this suit case

00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,700
So I go to the second floor

00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:47,700
The door to my sister's apartment doesn't open,
I go to the neighbour place, I knew her

00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:53,200
The neighbour, pale as a ghost, mumbles
'what, you are here', and tries to close the door

00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,700
I stuck my foot in the door and would let go

00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,200
She said, just recently, 
about 2 days ago Klara was arrested, my sister

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,200
I had a lot of acquanintances in Sosnowiec,
it was my area of operations from before the War

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,200
I go to Staszka Solikówna, I recall, 
where I overnight with the suit case.

00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:22,000
But, early in the morning around 5am
I get up and send her with the suit case,
what was I to do?

00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,200
I told her to put it in storage
at the Post Office

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:32,200
The safest way, cheap suit case, for storage

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,200
She put it in storage
And what about me?

00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,200
By the station in Sosnowiec goes a tram to Katowice

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:45,000
I jump on, in the last minute almost running
on to the tram to Katowice

00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,800
But I notice that somebody else is jumping on 
from the other side into the tram

00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,200
So, I am being followed

00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,100
I am in Katowice

00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:03,000
In Katowice, near the Post Office we have our cell,
because we had to have cells 

00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:09,800
So I am going to ..., it was a cashier in 
a pharmacy, I am going to the pharmacy

00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:19,100
and loudly, in German, I ask for an aspirine
and I slip her the storage receipt from the Post Office

00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,300
with that valuable suit case

00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:27,000
I got rid of the receipt,
but I am still being followed

00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,300
I can feel I didn't loose him

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,400
And now, to the train, to Kraków

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I can feel that somebody is there, somebody else,
because they would switch, the same spy wouldn't 
follow all the way

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:50,000
On that border I got sweaty, so horribly,
I was so scared, but he was quiet, let me go

00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,700
He didn't arrest me at the border,
where it gets hard

00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:59,900
I had good papers, of course,
I don't remember in whose name

00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,500
and I arrive in Kraków

00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:07,000
but I can feel sombody is there
because a person has that 7th sense

00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,900
I can feel it,
so I need to loose him

00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:17,900
I recall, walking around, it is almost afternoon,
I take off my coat, put it down, 

00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:27,900
wait a bit in this house a few minutes,
in another, I go into the store, finally 
I go the train station

00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:35,900
and there I wait, on Kraków train station,
good few hours, 
I am waiting for the night train to Warszawa

00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:40,900
But now I have to warn Warszawa
so I go onto the platform 

00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,900
I am looking for a way out, 
how to escape those looks

00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:52,900
I look, 
and on the platform completely by happenstance 
I see Maria Witek with an inspection in Kraków

00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,400
completely by accident

00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,900
I slip her a note 'I am jeopardized' 

00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,900
Now I could breathe a sigh of relief

00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,900
I now new ..., Maria Witek from the underground
she will know what to do with it

00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,400
Now I am calm, 
I only know that I have to kill myself

00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,100
nothing else,
because there is no other way

00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,900
but, how does one kill oneself?

00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:19,900
how do you do it?

00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,500
Well, there is a simple way:

00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,900
in Warszawa step out of the train, 
jump in front of another running train,
and it will run me over

00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,600
but I want to live, 
I don't want to die

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,200
I want to evade those who are stalking me

00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,200
jump out of the running train

00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,800
I was affraid, I was affraid to jump out

00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:51,200
The dawn is breaking, 
we are approaching Żyrardów

00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:59,200
I say, now is the only chance I can save myself,
I will jump out

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:06,000
Slowly, one step at the time, 
in the doorway stands a Polish train conductor

00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,200
I tell him: hold the door

00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,200
He holds the door, I jump

00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:17,200
The train stops soon afterwrards,
but I don't know if that's because
they noticed me jump or 
is it stopping at a station

00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:24,200
So I jump up, run to the forest nearby

00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,200
I got to the forest,
'I am saved, I live'

00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:35,200
Then I took a long road, I walked the whole day,
from Żyrardów, through the forest

00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,800
in a round-about way all the way to Warszawa

00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,200
I report to our contact, I am back from my assignment

00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:56,300
When I mention the contact of the pharmacy cashier
in Katowice, that suitcase was so important that she
took it to Kraków personally

00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:04,000
from there she sent a courier, they got the suitcase 
with dollars and I am alive

00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:24,000
They issued a warrant letter to trace me, I have 
a number of this letter which contained my name and 
place of birth, Elizabeth Zawacki, Toruń

00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:33,000
And that's how they located my family, and they
arrested my whole family, besides Klara who was 
in Sosnoweiec

00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:38,000
They took my old father, 
mother and my older sister

00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:45,100
They arrested my brother, the one who latter perished 
in Auschwitz

00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:58,400
I could have, and Marcysia knew it, gone to Ciechanów
and attempt to rescue him.  They would have given me
the money, I suspect.

00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:11,800
But it was almost certain they would have caught me 
and arrest me and I, in turn, 
could have broken down under investigation

00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:19,700
At that time I already had very many addresses memorized
and I decided to give up on helping my brother

00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:41,000
During the occupation, as my trips as a courier 
were sporadic, I was able to study

00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I was studying in a free, covert Polish school
I was audting courses and in the meantime, every two
or three weeks apart I would make a trip

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:15,100
Polish Law did not give women the right to join 
armed forces, they could only participate 
as civilian aids

00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:20,800
that was the reason for my mission to London:
to regulate women's military service,
to get those right for women

00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:31,200
to tranform a civilian aid into a regular 
soldier of the Polish Commonwealth

00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:41,400
For four months I was studying courier paths to London

00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:53,600
and parcels were huge, monthly, with a few hundred pages 
on microfiche, with maps, graphs, our conspiracy worked so well

00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:05,300
The had to dig up the archives after the War so I could 
reconstruct the courier paths

00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:14,400
from Warszawa through Germany, France, Southern France,
because it was separated by the border, Pirenees

00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,500
and there, using my senses and without the help of our
network I crossed
 
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:33,400
It was very difficult, I report to (gen.) Sikorski
that (gen.) Grot is asking that I report to him 
the state of communication in the country 

00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,900
and to return with his instructions

00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:47,300
he listened but he realized I was going to return
to Poland, and normally the couriers did not return

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,200
and him, instead of listening to the report of 
a humble soldier, who just arrived from the home country

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,200
of the hour of the meeting he was telling me 
for 50 minutes that they are sabotaging 
his efforts

and in reference to my report he said,
'when I come back, I have go to the East'

but he did not return from the East
he died in Gibraltar

'when I return I will listen to find out
of the state of communications'

He gave orders to the army in Poland, 
but he didn't know about the situation in the country

and I must add, he didn't attempt to find out 
about the situation

I came there straight from Poland, I could have 
told them much, perhaps I didn't know how to tell it
but they showed no interest in the situation in Poland

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,900
They served Poland but they didn't 
understand the situation

00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:01,200
they lived their private lives, 
drinking their coffees their breakfasts, 
they had everything and we had nothing


00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:13,200
it is a beautiful flight, but it is not me
approaching the ground, 
the ground is approaching me

00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:23,200
it is getting closer, and I jump,
I broke my heel, very painful

00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:23,200
I was the first, after me one guy ended up
on a roof, the other a bit far, 
but they found us

00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:23,200
but just before landing I am yelling out
the password 'Janka', they recieve me

and, as usual, they want to hug me, 
but they jump away, 'woman!'

that receiving party from AK that was below

well, they accepted 'that woman', 
there I waited until the other landed
and got picked up

00:22:53,900 --> 00:23:11,200
and then for 3/4 of an hour, with that hurting heel, 
circling around the forest we've reached our cell

00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:17,200
I returned right away to my work 
in the underground, to the pen

I had to pass on the information 
they didn't have in Poland

the whole thing was like this:
London co-operated with Warszawa,

Warszawa absolutely didn't know 
that London was completely dependant
on the English

and expected too much from them

and London was not familiar with 
our situation, and with their 
unreasonable orders they impared our work

so I went to clarify it,
well, I tried to do it, but
it was almost the end of the war

00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:17,200
11th of January '44 I was still on a trip to 
Switzerland, I had a cell in Vienna called 'Waltz'

and I was comming from there and I wanted to 
go to Warszawa, to report on my mission, as usual

I arrive in Sosnowiec where I find the front,
the Russians are already here

I wanted to get to demolished Warszawa

I recall comming from the train station, 
because the train did reach demolished Warszawa, 
only went as far as Szczęśliwice

I was walking by foot from Szczęśliwice
to Warszawa and I was singing
'This is the day of blood, this is the day...' 

00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:14,200
The Russians had such methods of corroding 
the society, they had their spies everywhere 
who reported 

00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,200
We regarded them as honest, decent Poles
but they were agents, and they spied

00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:28,200
I didn't know who was betraying me
the commies organized manhunts, 
great manhunts

00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:28,200
they've been watching for a long time

00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,200
there were those trials, those prisons 

00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,200
those horrible arrests of AK soldiers

00:25:39,300 --> 00:26:01,200
it was like that

00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:49,200
In Olsztyn, they arrested me in 1951, 
that's when everything ended

00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,200
I was imprisoned, 
naturally, they spared no death threats
since I was a former AK member

00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:59,200
I ended up getting 10 years, 
the sentence of 10 years

00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:07,900
later those 10 years got shortened to 4
and was released during the period of 'the thaw'

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:17,200
Even this UB prison, however many years, 
nothing, it was not important

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,200
it was important to be able to do something

00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,200
I wanted to be a reasercher
and I managed

00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:24,200
thought it took a while after my prison term 
until I've put everything back together

00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,200
One time they destroyed all my research materials

But I finished my doctorate in '65
and all my time I was involved in research

this filled my days

I had a rare specialization:
adult education

In particular, I wanted to start an 
open University, similar to the one
in Great Britan

and I was preparing professorship

selection commitee was in session

A big Institue of Education at University 
created to remove me, did not create 
the department of Andagogy

and then I could retire, and I retired

then I got involved in intense work,
let's call it, service dedicated to memory 
of the fate of the nation

because all togehter it is 
the life of the nation

in which each of us played our tiny part

that we had to rediscover, this underground service

we immediately needed to establish archives
of AK in Pomerania region

and it happened, 
but this is just one section: Pomerania

in addition, we were looking 
for information about women of Pomerania

and then we widened our scope, 
then we created an archive dedicated 
to women in war service

all fighting women
civilian and uniformed
in the East and in the West

I was collecting, we are trying to
put together this Museum

and the third archive is my beloved,
it is an archive of a single detachment
of Polish Underground

communication between Warszawa and London

00:28:52,200 --> 00:29:03,400
when I am approaching 100 (years of age)
I have one task, actually two tasks ahead of me
which I have to complete

the first to finish publishing of the 
dictionary of women decorated with 
cross Virituti Militari

I am always concerned that 
I will run out of time
before I finish what I started

and the last task of my life is 
to make sure that Warszawa gets a 

monument commemorating this great accomplishment of women

involvment of women, half of the nation,
in saving of the nation

I don't like this word 'hero', because
that is not what I am interested in

because a heroic act is singular, 
even if it is a great effort/sacrifice

but it is about continuous service, 
this complete devotion, sacrifice of your family,
everything for the service

00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Poland is raising new generations,
Poland, when rich culturally,
is better prepared to form new generations

it is rich, and that is this flow of history
it is necessary that the culture is 
being enriched continously

00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
so the next generation can access as much
as possible, and not loose out because 
there is no record of the past

I feel that those experiences need 
to be passed on

the nation cannot loose a single generation

your generation also has to find its place in history
